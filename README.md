# KIT Assignments Downloader

An unofficial KIT assignments downloader for [ilias.studium.kit.edu](http://ilias.studium.kit.edu/).


## Why do I need this?

Using *kita*, you will not have to care about keeping your assignments up to date **ever again**.  
*Kita* automatically logs in to your ilias account, downloads the latest assignment of all your classes and moves them to the correct folders in your KIT directory - with just one command.

*Contents*: **[Requirements](#requirements)** | **[Installation and setup](#installation-and-setup)** | **[Getting started](#getting-started)** | **[Supported courses](#supported-courses)** | **[Adding new courses](#adding-new-courses)**

## Requirements

If you are using Windows, make sure [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (including pip and tkinter) is installed on your computer. Also note that kita currently only supports the **Firefox** browser.

## Installation and setup
 
To install this package open a console and type:

    pip install kita
  
To complete the installation use the following command:

    kita setup
      
Note: The setup assistant requires you to input your ilias user name and password which will be stored locally in a file called user.yml. **Do not share this file!**

## Getting started

After the setup is complete, you can start downloading assignments. Type `-h` or `--help` after a specific command for more information about that command.  
```
kita update [OPTIONS] [CLASS_NAMES]...
```
**Example:** `kita update la`  
Scans your 'Lineare Algebra 1' directory as specified during setup. Downloads the latest assignment for this course and renames the files.  

**Options:**
`--all`/`-a` update assignment directories for all your courses.

    kita get [OPTIONS] [CLASS_NAMES]... ASSIGNMENT_NUM
    
**Example:** `kita get la 9`  
Downloads the 9th assignment from your course Lineare Algebra 1. You can download assignments from multiple courses at once by separating them by a space, e.g: `kita get la gbi 9`.  
 
**Options:**: 
`--move`/`-mv`: move and rename your downloaded files if you have specified a location in the user.yml file.  
`--all`/`-a`: Download assignments for all your courses.  
  ```update```
  ```move```
