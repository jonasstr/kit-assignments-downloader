# KIT Assignments Downloader 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonasstr/kit-assignments-downloader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonasstr/kit-assignments-downloader)

An unofficial assignments downloader for [ilias.studium.kit.edu](http://ilias.studium.kit.edu/).  

## Why do I need this?

With kit-dl, keeping your assignments up to date has become a thing of the past.  
Kit-dl automatically logs in to your ilias account, downloads the latest assignment of all your classes and moves them to the correct folders in your KIT directory - with just one command.

## Requirements
Platform: **Windows**   
Browser: **Firefox**  
Support for more operating systems and browsers may be added in the future.  
Make sure [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (including pip and tkinter) is installed on your computer.

## Installation and setup
 
To install this package open a console and type:

    pip install kit-dl
  
To complete the installation use the following command:

    kit-dl setup      
Note: The setup assistant requires you to input your ilias user name and password which will be stored locally in a file called user.yml. **Do not share this file!**

## Getting started

After the setup is complete, you can start downloading assignments. Type `-h` or `--help` after a specific command for more information about that command. For a list of currently supported courses see section supported courses.

Download the latest assignments for all your courses:
```
kit-dl update
```
---
You can also update one or more specific courses:
```
kit-dl update [COURSE_NAMES]...
```
**Example:** `kit-dl update la gbi`  
Update your 'Lineare Algebra I' and 'Grundbegriffe der Informatik' assignments.

---
If you only want to download specific assignments you can use:
```
kit-dl get [COURSE_NAMES]... ASSIGNMENT_NUM
```
**Example:** `kit-dl get la gbi 12`  
Download the assignment #12 from both 'Lineare Algebra I' and 'Grundbegriffe der Informatik'.  
**Example:** `kit-dl get la gbi 10-12` or `kit-dl get la gbi 10,11,12`  
Download the assignments #10 to #12.
